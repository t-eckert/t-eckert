Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Thomas Eckert. I live in Seattle, Washington with my wife, Sophia, and our corgi, Winona.

I studied physics, focusing on nuclear interactions for fusion diagnostics. Much of this work involved programming simulations in C++. I wrote a [thesis](https://www.houghton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/physics-thesis-thomas-eckert-2016.pdf) and a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09375.pdf) about it.

After completing my Masters of Physics at the University of Rochester, I moved to Seattle and started working at Microsoft as an engineer. Today, I build platform tooling for defining SLOs on Azure.

When I'm not coding I can be found painting watercolors.
