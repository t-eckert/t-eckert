Hi my name is Thomas Eckert (he/him). I live outside of Washington D.C. with my wife, Sophia, and our corgi, Winona.

I work on Consul integration with Kubernetes at HashiCorp. Before working at HashiCorp, I worked on Azure at Microsoft. In school, I studied physics, focusing on diagnostics for nuclear fusion in my Masters.

I'm always fascinated with learning new programming languages and ways of thinking. I believe every language is a reflection of the way a person or a set of people think. I love digging into podcasts and learning new stuff on YouTube. You can also get me talking about transit and the value of cycling infrastructure.
