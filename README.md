Hi my name is Thomas Eckert (he/him). I live in Ottawa, ON ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ with my wife, Sophia, and our corgi, Winona.

I work the Redpanda Cloud platform. In school, I studied physics, focusing on diagnostics for nuclear fusion in my Masters.

After school, I went to Microsoft where I worked on Azure, mainly in reliability. From Microsoft, I went to HashiCorp where I worked on Consul, particularly deployment on Kubernetes for service mesh and the Kubernetes API Gateway implementation of Consul. Now, at Redpanda, I work on operational reliability for the cloud. 

I'm always fascinated with learning new programming languages and ways of thinking. I believe every language is a reflection of the way a person or a set of people think. I love digging into podcasts and learning new stuff on YouTube. You can also get me talking about transit and the value of cycling infrastructure.
